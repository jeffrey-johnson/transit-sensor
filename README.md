#Public transportation offers a convenient, affordable, and sustainable mean of transportation. However, public transportation can also be very inconvenient, as many individuals choose to take this form of transportation due to its affordability. This, in turn, causes a limited amount of open seats. These problems are studied and researched by transit planners who are tasked with forecasting long term demands and traffic patterns. 

#Real time data collection has become increasingly easy with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth-enabled devices. With this form of collection, our data will allow transit planners to help pedestrians establish better wait time and arrival time estimations.
#However, data collection through Bluetooth and Wi-Fi can also be problematic and costly which is why we aim to create an inexpensive wireless system that uses off-the-shelf Bluetooth and wireless hardware to wirelessly detect end-to-end passenger journeys.
